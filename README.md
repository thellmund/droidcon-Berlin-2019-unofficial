#### Note
Because there is no official API, the information in the app might become outdated if there are changes to the schedule. Still, I hope you find it useful.

#### Come say hi!
I’m attending the conference with my colleagues from [Freeletics](https://freeletics.com) – come say hi, chat about cool Android stuff, and be sure to watch [their talk on Coroutines Flow](https://www.de.droidcon.com/speaker/Hannes-Dorfmann-%26-Gabriel-Ittner).

Yes, the code is bad. I built the app in a couple of nights. I’ll do better next year.
