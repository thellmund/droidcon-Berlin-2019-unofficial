Not getting sued gives you more time to develop your app and expand your business. It helps you to avoid awkward calls with your lawyers. And no one wants those.\n\nThe session will be for 60 minutes and cover two different topics. First we will provide you with an analyses from a few GDPR cases that actually lead to fines by data protection authorities. We will cover what were the factual and legal reasons for those fines and what are the lessons learned from these cases. The idea is to enable you to avoid data protection violations already committed by other parties in the past. The second part of the session will comprise nearly everything that has to do with mobile gaming. We will take about mobile payments and in-app purchases – not only interesting for the game developers – as well as how to avoid legal pitfalls concerning the content and marketing of games.\n\nBoth session will have a Q&A.

In this talk, I’ll cover some of the lessons we learned while gradually migrating from a RecyclerView.Adapter, populated from a tightly coupled domain and presentation layers, to Paging library. You’ll learn about the main components of the Paging library, where they fit in your architecture, how decoupling the UI and the data/domain layers results in more maintainable & testable code. You’ll understand which DataSource type you need for your use case see how you can display multiple data types in the same RecyclerView and how to handle other use cases like interactions with a view item, deleting or inserting an item, selection states or showing section headers. Learn from our experience how to migrate to paging and the benefits we saw.",

Android applications have begun increasingly reactive using architectures like MVVM, MVI, Redux, etc., The reactive nature of these applications are due to the underlying architecture rather than the UI framework itself. This has resulted in some big wins like testability and strong separation of concerns while trading-off attributes like time-to-market and quickly on-boarding new developers to an existing project.\n\nThe API surface of the Android UI framework has been the same for the past decade. This was largely because of the limitations imposed by old tooling and the programming language. With Kotlin bringing in DSLs, functional programming and compiler plugin capabilities - the members of the Android UI Toolkit team have rolled up their sleeves and are taking a new direction. The new UI toolkit is backed by principles and techniques like - one-way data flow, function composition, declarative programming, optimistic concurrency control, isolation of side-effects, etc.,\n\nThis shift in API design also demands a shift in thinking about the app architecture and building UIs. In this talk, we’ll see how Jetpack Compose is radically different from the existing Android UI framework and how it adopts several ideas and programming patterns from web frameworks like React, MobX, and Vue.js. We will also see examples of these patterns and use them to build Android apps.",

From rounds of manual regression testing then onto automated UI testing now to isolated code level tests and what’s next for the team.\n\nThen: How we started with UI automation to help us release quicker and what it actually gave us: fast checks of key user journeys but not an automated regression test suite that could help us release faster.\n\nNow: How we looked to push more of our testing down the stack into unit testing, but starting with building a team understanding of what unit tests actually are. How we broke down our system into interdependent components that could be tested in isolation and the architecture we used to push this further. All explained through a real life example of how we moved to the new ExoPlayer from google.\nNext: What new problems this approach has given us, how we plan tackle them and how we will bring this approach this to other teams across the BBC.\n\nKey takeaways\n- Testing: What has and hasn’t worked with our testing from manual to automated testing and everything in between\n- Pairing: How we collaboratively pair tester and developers to write code level tests\n- Team structure: How our teams are organised and why\n- Risk Vs Value: How we balance the risk of not testing Vs value of testing it ",

It is also a heavily researched topic by developers with 20k questions on stack overflow(2k+ for dagger).\nWhile most projects use dagger as a de-facto framework for Android, this talk would be more focussed on understanding concepts of DI and applying the same without a framework. We’ll go through concepts of supplying dependencies, various types of injection and understanding inversion of control. All of this without using a framework, with raw code in Kotlin and an actual android app with real life problems around networking, storage and threading.\nWe’ll then dig deep in how libraries like Dagger, Koin etc operate to provide the same with code generation or reflection.",

You’re lost !\n\nGrox is an open source library (https://github.com/groupon/grox) that helps to manage the state of Kotlin / Java / Android applications. Inspired by Flux and Redux, Grox lets you express state changes in a testable and homogenous way. Grox offers a flexible, scalable way to manage the state of your application. With Grox you know in which exact state you are at any point in time, and you state will be represented clearly. Grox also offers time travel debugging, and a nice Rx API that plays very well with RxBinding and asynchronous code.\n\nIn this session, we will explain why Grox is nice, give a few examples to use it, test your code and enjoy it’s scalability.

Minimalism in computing is not a novel idea, it existed back in the 80s when the resources were very expensive and limited.\n\nNowadays, our software development processes seem to have forgot about it. We deploy entire frameworks, or even entire operating systems, to perform a single task. We include libraries in our projects even when we just need a single method. We create bloated products that cram as much features as we can, rather than focusing on doing one thing right. As well, we have problems focusing at work, we struggle to get things done, and all together our mental health is not improving.\n\nI believe that is all related, that we should take a step back, simplify, start small, and declutter.\n\nCome and learn about the principles of minimalism, and how to apply them to your personal and professional life.
